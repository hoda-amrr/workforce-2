### `Resources/`
- **`PO/`**:  
  Contains screen-specific Page Object files. Each screen must have its own `.robot` file defining element locators.

- **`Keywords/`**:  
  Contains modular and reusable keyword files. Group related actions per functionality (e.g., login, navigation, validations).

- **`Common.robot`**:  
  A centralized file for generic keywords used across multiple test cases and screens.

### `Tests/`
- Each screen/module must have its own dedicated test case file.
- Naming should reflect the screen's purpose to aid quick identification.

### `Results/`
- Stores Robot Frameworkâ€™s output files (`output.xml`, `log.html`, `report.html`, etc.)

- Each test run result should be saved here.
